Assignment


  Here is the current state of our users table: 


 Our business strategy team at CashPal wants to know how many users
 of the app we have. We can't use the id number to calculate
 the count because user accounts can be deleted! Use
 a COUNT(*) statement to retrieve the number of records
 in the users table. In this course, stick to using
 * with COUNT unless the instructions specifically say
 to count a particular column.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
